Hi, my name is Claudia and I work remotely as a **freelance data scientist**. I hold a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in science (Business Analytics, VU University Amsterdam).

Since I was young, I have always enjoyed to solve puzzles. So that’s how I look at big data sets: to me it is one big puzzle I want to solve. Finding patterns nobody else sees is the challenge to me.

I have been working as a data scientist for **more than ten years** with experience in transport, logistics and retail. I have worked for more than 25 companies which gives me the ability to translate complex questions into understandable insights.

Do you want to work together? Please reach out to me by e-mail.
