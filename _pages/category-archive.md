## Overview
--------------
Hi! My name is Elly Seonju Jin and I am recently working as Business Operations at WeWork Korea. 

I was always interested in data and numbers, but never had any formal experience before WeWork. My love of learning and curiosity about how things work led me to start the career journey with WeWork by finding ways of leearning myself new skills on my own time. As a self-taught person who in the Real-Estate industry for 2 years, I’ve obtained the certifications for all practical data tools (Snowflake, Power BI, Tableau) which is used in work.

This overview will give you what I did and learned to embark on a journey to become experienced data analyst!

## I Took Over 10 Online Courses
---------------
As you can see, I didn’t go to school for data science or statistics. However, I could acquire practical skills like data validation, understanding of business context, etc. 

To more improvement of my capability in work, I started with a few online courses that I found on Udemy and Coursera. The Tableau was the first class I took and it really got me interested in learning more about data and visualization which has been my passion for quite some time now so naturally it made sense to take their course. After this course, I accelerated to take other courses like SQL, Snowflake, Power BI. These courses really helped me learn the fundamentals of data and how to apply them in my work. I was able to figure out what needed to be working on, how approached problems.

## The only data person in company 
----------------
Since the main data team is in New York, I am the only person who is responsible for Ad hoc analytics and managing the data for leadership in my region. I am faced with new challenges every day — with data, business problem statements, data management, quality, etc. It is not easy, but the good part is that I can be more a creative to solve the problem every day. Whenever the team needs me, I need to open a problem and ask, “what if”. Through numerous situations, I realized there is always some insights to be revealed, and something waiting to be discovered in data.

The below is the skills during I’ve acquired working with business functions in company.

## (1) Analytical skills
This includes problem-solving, critical thinking, research skills, and mathematical abilities. For example, when I receive the Ad hoc analytics request, I always trying to look in to find relationships between disparate events and patterns to reveal a common thread, an underlying cause of occurrences that, on a surface level, may appear unrelated and unexplainable. (ex: correlation between churn rate and ticket quantity) 


## (2) Soft skills
To understand certain complex concepts and converting them into precise recommendations, I always tried to have a firm grasp of the business context with stakeholders from different departments. For example, When explaining the results of the analysis to the department, I took these three steps (The problem statement→ The data I used to solve the problem→ The result that I obtained) to explain. 

## (3) Creating Dashboards and Reports
For successful Dashboard, my first priority is understanding the target audience and purpose to better align the contents and metrics to suit different needs and convey the right message. For example, Marketing Team might be more involved in the overall process of promoting and selling a product or service but Sales teams will probably refer to the specific tactics and techniques used to achieve sales goals.
