## Overview
--------------
Hi! My name is Elly Seonju Jin and I am recently working as Business Operations at WeWork Korea. 

I was always interested in data and numbers, but never had any formal experience before WeWork. My love of learning and curiosity about how things work led me to start the career journey with WeWork by finding ways of leearning myself new skills on my own time. As a self-taught person who in the Real-Estate industry for 2 years, Iâ€™ve obtained the certifications for all practical data tools (Snowflake, Power BI, Tableau) which is used in work.
